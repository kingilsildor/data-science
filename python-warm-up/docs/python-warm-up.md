## Materials

- [Python Coding Warm-Up Online Notebook](python-warm-up-notebook)

## Usage

Follow the steps below to set up the notebook:
- Have the [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install) environment ready.
- Download the python coding warm-up [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MultiX-Amsterdam/python-warm-up). Or you can also download the zip file from [this link](https://github.com/MultiX-Amsterdam/python-warm-up/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
- Open the notebook file (`docs/python-warm-up-notebook.ipynb`) and start working on the tasks.

Follow the steps below to do the tasks:
- First, for each task, try your best to implement the solution without checking the answer.
- In the meantime, use the hint in the task description. You can also check the functions that are mentioned in the hint online.
- Try your best to implement the solution using the functions in the hint. If you still have no clue, check the answer, understand how it works, and implement the solution again by yourself.
- If there are parts that you do not understand, feel free to ask questions during the work sessions or on Canvas.

## Additional Recourses

Check the [pandas API](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html) when writing the code.
If you have finished the tasks and want to practice more, below are some resources for self-study:
- [Introduction to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html)
- [Introduction to Numpy](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2020/numpy-intro.html)
